## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Tailwindcss
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Well, this is my very first Frontend Mentor challenge, and it happened to coincide with my discovery of Tailwindcss. Naturally, I decided to use the framework for this project. You know, for something that looks so easy, it was a lot of going back-and-forth between VSCode, Tailwindcss docs, StackOverflow and other sites. It was also while working on this project that I got familiar with flexbox in CSS. 

### Useful resources

- [Tailwindcss docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/) 
- [Flexbox article](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/understanding-flexbox-everything-you-need-to-know-b4013d4dc9af/) - Helped me a lot in getting acquainted with flexbox.
